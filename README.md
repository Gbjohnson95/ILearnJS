# ILearnJS

This point of this is to build a platform independant replacestring/macro library for use with BYU-Idaho. 

Features planned for v0.1
- LaTeX rendering via KaTeX from Khan Acadamy. WAY faster than MathJax
- Retrival of basic user data like names
- Retrival of basic course info like course name & section number
- Link making to course calender, home, and annoucements

Some features I would like to impliment down the road are

- Move to more effienent method of only pulling innerHTML once
- Grab a scripture using something like ##SCPTR:BoM/1Nep/3/2:10##
- Impliment a ##DaysTillDue## and ##HoursTillDue##
- Get instructor info like ##InstructorEmail## and ##InstructorName##
